## Why analysis of algorithms is important? 

- Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem.
- Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
- To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.
- More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.
- It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm. There are too many influencing factors.
- The analysis is thus only an approximation; it is not perfect.

## Explain: Worst Case, Best Case and Average Case Complexity with suitable example

- Types of Algorithm Analysis:
  - Best case 
  - Worst case
  - Average case
