# Algorithm

- An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some values or set of values as input and produces some values or set of values as output.
- An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.
- An algorithm is a set of rules for carrying out calculation either by hand or on a machine.
- An algorithm is an abstraction of a program to be executed on a physical machine (model of Computation).

## Properties of Algorithm
- All the algorithms should satisfy following five properties :
- **1.Finiteness** : An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **2.Definiteness** : Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined.
- **3.Input** : An algorithm has zero or more inputs.
- **4.Output** : An algorithm must have at least one desirable output.
- **5.Effectiveness** : The instructions which are used to accomplish the task must be basic i.e. the human
being can trace the instructions by using paper and pencil in every way.
